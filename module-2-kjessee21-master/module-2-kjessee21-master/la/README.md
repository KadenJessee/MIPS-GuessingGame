## MIPS Concepts
In this module, you will continue learn the basics of MIPS including the following topics:
- Logical Shift
- Branch instructions
- Space and Align directives
- Memory offsets

## Program 1
- Getting started: basic_branches.asm
- Review of mips structure, printing strings and reading integers
- Using branch instructions for if, else if, and else statements

## Program 2
- basic_loops.asm
- Using branch instructions for loops (for, while, do while)

## Program 3
-loop_sort_verifier.asm
- Putting it all together
- Get user input in a loop
- Store values in an array
- Check values for ascending order
